Text: """Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is the first book in Rick Riordan’s
fantasy-adventure series centered around modern-day Greek mythology. The story follows
Percy Jackson, a 12-year-old boy with dyslexia and ADHD, who discovers he is actually a
demigod—the son of Poseidon, god of the sea. Percy’s journey begins when he is attacked by
a Fury during a school trip, leading to the revelation of his true identity. After a series of
chaotic events, he arrives at Camp Half-Blood, a sanctuary for demigod children, where he
trains and learns more about his divine heritage. Soon, Percy learns that Zeus’s master
lightning bolt has been stolen, and he is the prime suspect due to being a child of one of the
“Big Three” gods—Poseidon, Hades, and Zeus— who had made a pact not to have more
children. To clear his name and prevent a war among the gods, Percy sets out on a quest with
his friends: Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, and Grover, a satyr and his protector. Their
journey takes them across the United States as they face various mythological monsters and
challenges rooted in Greek lore. Along the way, Percy discovers more about his powers, his
father’s world, and the dangerous politics of Mount Olympus. Eventually, Percy confronts
Ares, the god of war, and retrieves the lightning bolt. He returns it to Zeus, averting a divine
conflict. However, a darker threat emerges with hints of Kronos, the Titan lord, seeking to
return. The book blends humor, action, and mythology, presenting a coming-of-age tale
about identity, friendship, and courage. With relatable characters and a fast-paced narrative,
The Lightning Thief introduces readers to a captivating world where ancient gods and
modern life collide.
